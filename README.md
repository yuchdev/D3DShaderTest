# Basic Direct3D shaders project

Purpose of the project is testing 3D API under different virtualization solutions, specifically researching System Fingerprint, and how if affects WebGL implementation for frontend rendering engines of Chrome and Firefox.

It uses basic Direct3D API and loads several shaders. Could serve as a very basic intro into Direct3D API.
